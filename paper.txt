Abstract
Traditional pairs trading strategies often fail to identify stable mean-
reverting relationships amid the complex dynamics characterizing
modern financial markets, resulting in unstable spreads and re-
duced efficacy of conventional, rule-based execution methods. To
overcome these intrinsic limitations, this study introduces ORCA
(Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Reversion and Contrastive Arbitrage), a novel
framework that seamlessly integrates deep representation learn-
ing and a rigorous financial dynamics model into a unified train-
ing paradigm. Central to ORCA is a physics-informed regulariza-
tion approach designed to identify asset clusters that exhibit not
merely similarity, but intrinsic tradability characterized by robust
dynamic properties. ORCA concurrently optimizes a contrastive
learning module alongside a Physics-Informed Neural Network
(PINN) module, where the latter serves as a regularizer enforcing
cluster formation consistent with the statistical dynamics of a stable
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Consequently, ORCA systematically
produces asset clusters with inherently superior mean-reversion
characteristics. Empirical analysis conducted on the NYSE dataset
demonstrates the practical effectiveness of ORCA: applying a simple
mean-reversion trading strategy with a static threshold to ORCA-
generated clusters significantly outperforms strategies employing
clusters derived via alternative benchmark methodologies. These
findings position ORCA as a new benchmark methodology in the
realm of structure-aware statistical arbitrage. A comprehensive
overview of empirical results is provided in Figure 1.

1 Introduction
Pairs trading [ 5] is a market-neutral strategy that leverages the
mean-reverting nature of spreads between assets sharing com-
mon economic links. Its principle involves identifying asset pairs
whose prices have historically co-moved and executing arbitrage
trades—taking a long position in the underperforming asset and a
short position in the outperforming one—when their price spread
diverges from statistical equilibrium.
However, the success of this traditional approach faces two fun-
damental challenges. First, the pair selection process often fails
to capture complex, nonlinear relationships between assets. Tradi-
tional statistical methods frequently rely on superficial similarities
in raw feature space, which can lead to the selection of unstable
pairs in dynamic market environments [ 29]. Second, the low qual-
ity of the selected pairs inherently amplifies instability during the
trade execution phase. Spreads derived from these suboptimal pairs
are often noisy and exhibit weak mean-reverting characteristics.
Consequently, when a simple rule-based method is applied to these
unstable signals, it inevitably leads to inefficient outcomes, such as
being whipsawed by noise or failing to capture faint signals.
To transcend these limitations, we introduce ORCA (Ornstein-
Uhlenbeck Reversion and Contrastive Arbitrage), a novel frame-
work that synergistically integrates deep representation learning
with an economic theory-based financial model within a single,
unified training process. ORCA’s core innovation lies in identifying

asset clusters that are not merely similar, but are inherently trad-
able with strong dynamic properties, a concept we enforce through
physics-informed regularization.
Our framework simultaneously optimizes a contrastive learn-
ing module and a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) mod-
ule [25]. While contrastive learning [ 2] elucidates the latent struc-
tures within the data to build robust asset representations, the PINN
module acts as a regularizer. It compels the clustering framework
to form groups whose members collectively adhere to the statistical
properties of a stable Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) stochastic differ-
ential equation. Through this integrated learning process, ORCA
evolves to produce higher-quality asset clusters with intrinsically
enhanced mean-reverting characteristics.
The main contributions of this paper are as follows:
•A novel end-to-end framework integrating contrastive learn-
ing with Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) is pro-
posed to systematically identify intrinsically tradable asset
clusters.
•A new learning paradigm leveraging PINNs as a regular-
ization mechanism is introduced, compelling the clustering
process to adhere strictly to established financial engineering
dynamics, specifically the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.
•Comprehensive empirical validation using extensive real-
world NYSE market data demonstrates that conventional
mean-reversion trading strategies significantly outperform
alternative benchmark methodologies when applied to clus-
ters identified by the proposed ORCA framework.

2.1 Contrastive Learning
Contrastive learning [ 24] is a promising paradigm in self-supervised
learning, recently achieving new benchmarks in representation
learning in fields such as computer vision [ 2,10,15] and natural
language processing [ 6]. The fundamental idea of this approach is
to map the original data into a representation space, wherein the
similarities of positive pairs are maximized while those of negative
pairs are minimized [ 12]. We primarily follow the SimCLR’s [ 2]
temperature-scaled cross-entropy loss (NT-Xent). Building a pos-
itive pair through data augmentation is essential for contrastive
learning. In computer vision, positive pairs are created by perform-
ing random transformations on the same image, such as cropping,
flipping, and jittering [ 10,15]. Natural language processing uses
methods such as dropout [ 6] and discrete masking [ 3] to build posi-
tive pairs. Unlike the above two areas, we take a different approach
to building positive pairs for tabular data by using random masking,
which randomly erases values as zero, and Gaussian noise.
2.2 Physics-Informed Neural Networks in
Finance
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a
powerful tool for modeling systems governed by differential equa-
tions [ 25]. The core idea of the PINNs paradigm is to incorporate
the residual of a differential equation into the neural network’s loss
function, thereby compelling the model to not only fit the data but
also adhere to the underlying physical law. This paradigm has beensuccessfully applied in financial engineering, particularly for option
pricing. For instance, PINNs have been utilized to solve the Black-
Scholes Partial Differential Equation (PDE) in data-scarce regions,
price exotic options, and calibrate market volatility surfaces [ 7,13].
These studies demonstrate the effectiveness of PINNs in model-
ing the complex dynamics of financial markets. Our work applies
this idea to pairs trading by incorporating the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
(OU) Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE), which governs the
mean-reverting dynamics of a spread, into the learning process.
2.3 Machine Learning in Pairs Trading
Recent developments in pairs trading have focused on integrating
machine learning techniques to enhance performance. Unsuper-
vised learning methods, such as clustering algorithms, have been
employed to identify complex, non-linear relationships that tradi-
tional statistical measures may overlook [ 26]. For example, K-means
clustering has been utilized to group assets based on similarities in
their feature representations, providing a more nuanced approach
than linear models. Meanwhile, reinforcement learning (RL) has also
been explored as a promising avenue in pairs trading [ 1,18,31]. RL
agents optimize trading strategies by learning directly from market
dynamics via a reward mechanism. However, RL can often overfit
to specific asset pairs and its need for direct interaction with the
environment can make it challenging to apply to a large universe
of assets.
Most existing approaches tend to focus on either improving pair
selection or enhancing trading execution. In this paper, we propose
to unify robust, data-driven pairing via contrastive learning with
financial dynamic modeling through the integration of a PINN
framework.
3 Method
Our proposed framework, ORCA, is designed to identify inherently
tradable asset clusters through a unified, end-to-end training pro-
cess. This is achieved through three interconnected components: (1)
a Backbone Architecture that extracts rich, dynamic representations
for each asset from raw data; (2) a Physics-Informed Contrastive
Clustering module that uses a novel unified loss function to simul-
taneously learn asset similarities and enforce that the resulting
clusters adhere to the principles of mean-reversion, specifically the
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process; and (3) a Cluster-Based Trading
Strategy that leverages these high-quality clusters to execute trades.
The overall architecture is depicted in Figure 2.
3.1 Backbone Architecture
The backbone is designed to extract rich asset representations us-
ing a feature encoder and a bidirectional transformer. Since deep
learning models can underperform boosting methods on tabular
data [ 11,27], we employ a specialized feature encoder based on
Piece-wise Linear Encoding (PLE), a modern binning approach with
proven success in tabular deep learning [ 9,21]. Unlike continuous
embeddings such as linear layers, PLE explicitly preserves ordi-
nal relationships and creates informative representations robust
to outliers. The resulting tokens are processed by a bidirectional
transformer [ 28], which excels at capturing the complex relation-
ships between all input features, such as firm characteristics and

processed by a shared transformer encoder to produce representations h𝑎and h𝑏. The model optimizes three objectives: instance-
level contrastLins, cluster-level contrast Lclu, and physics-informed regularization LPINN that enforces Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
dynamics with parameters (ˆ𝜃𝑘,ˆ𝜇𝑘,ˆ𝜎𝑘).
price momentum [ 17,30]. This backbone ultimately outputs a rep-
resentation vector hfor each asset.
3.1.1 Tabular feature encoder. The feature encoder transforms
structured tabular data, where the 𝑘-th numerical feature 𝑥𝑘is
encoded as ˜𝑥𝑘=enc𝑘(𝑥𝑘) ∈R𝑑. Here, enc𝑘(·)is the encoder
for the𝑘-th feature and 𝑑is the embedding dimensionality. The
encoding process begins with binning. First, we normalize all fea-
tures using a standard scaler. Then, for each feature 𝑘, we define𝑇
bins,𝐵1,...,𝐵𝑇, with boundaries[𝑏𝑜,𝑏1),...,[𝑏𝑇−1,𝑏𝑇]. The first
bin𝐵1=(−∞,𝑏2)and the last bin 𝐵𝑇=[𝑏𝑇−1,∞)are unbounded
to ensure complete coverage of the feature domain. For a given
scalar value 𝑥, the PLE function transforms it into a 𝑇-dimensional
vector PLE(𝑥)=[𝑒1,...,𝑒𝑇]. The value of each component 𝑒𝑡is
determined by the following conditions:
𝑒𝑡= 
0, if𝑥<𝑏𝑡−1and𝑡>1
1, if𝑥≥𝑏𝑡and𝑡<𝑇
𝑥−𝑏𝑡−1
𝑏𝑡−𝑏𝑡−1,otherwise(1)
This encoding produces a cumulative representation: bins entirely
below𝑥𝑘are set to 1, the bin containing 𝑥𝑘receives a fractional
value based on its relative position within that bin, and bins above
𝑥𝑘are set to 0. This creates a dense, ordered representation of
the numerical feature. Finally, this 𝑇-dimensional vector is passed
through a trainable linear layer to produce the final 𝑑-dimensional
embedding that is fed into the transformer:
˜𝑥𝑘=Linear(PLE(𝑥𝑘)) (2)
3.1.2 Feature transformer. The feature transformer compresses
the characteristics of each asset into a single vector. To improve
the modeling of the complex relationships between asset charac-
teristics, we use a bidirectional transformer. This transformer is
internally structured with a multi-headed self-attention mechanism,
which allows it to reflect multifaceted information, including the
relationship between firm characteristics and price momentum,
from different perspectives within the feature vector. As a result,
the feature vector is embedded in the feature vector space withmore comprehensive attributes. The mathematical formulation of
the multi-headed attention mechanism in our model is as follows:
Attention(𝑄,𝐾,𝑉)=softmax 
𝑄𝐾𝑇
√︁
𝑑𝑘!
𝑉 (3)
head𝑖=Attention(𝑄𝑊𝑄
𝑖,𝐾𝑊𝐾
𝑖,𝑉𝑊𝑉
𝑖)
MultiHead(𝑄,𝐾,𝑉)=Concat(head 1,..., headℎ)𝑊𝑂
Similar to BERT [ 4], the successful transformer architecture in
natural language processing, we append a special [CLS] token with
a learned embedding to the beginning of each data sample. Let
xi=[[CLS],˜x𝑖
1,˜x𝑖
2,..., ˜x𝑖𝑛]be the input sequence for a single asset,
composed of its features ˜x𝑖
𝑘encoded by binning. Let 𝑓(·)be the
feature transformer. The input sequence xiis transformed into a
sequence of hidden states, and the final representation for the asset,
h𝑖, is taken from the output corresponding to the [CLS] token’s
position via hi=𝑓(xi)[CLS] . This [CLS] token’s output vector
summarizes the information from all feature tokens through the
self-attention mechanism.
3.2 Physics-Informed Contrastive Clustering
Using the representation vector hfrom the backbone, we train our
model by optimizing a unified loss function with three objectives:
(1) learning instance-level representations, (2) forming a cluster-
level structure, and (3) ensuring the financial-dynamic validity of
the formed clusters.
3.2.1 Contrastive Representation Learning. Our representation learn-
ing is based on contrastive learning performed at two simultaneous
levels: the instance level and the cluster level. This dual approach
guides the model to learn the unique characteristics of individual
assets while concurrently forming a coherent macroscopic structure
among groups of assets.
First, instance-level contrastive learning trains the model to
learn a unique representation for each asset. The success of this
hinges on the construction of positive pairs through effective data
augmentation. To preserve the inherent characteristics of tabular
407

data while obtaining superior representation vectors, we employ
two relatively simple augmentation techniques: random masking
(𝜙mask), which sets a fraction of feature values to zero, and the
addition of Gaussian noise ( 𝜙Gauss ). These augmentations mirror
real-world data imperfections in financial markets, such as missing
fundamental data and noisy price observations, ensuring robustness
without introducing additional complexity.
An original input xis transformed into two different views, x𝑎=
𝜙mask(x)andx𝑏=𝜙Gauss(x). These augmented inputs are passed
through the backbone architecture 𝑓(·)and a non-linear projection
head𝑔ins(·)to be mapped into final representation vectors z𝑎and
z𝑏. The objective of instance contrastive learning is to maximize
the similarity between z𝑎andz𝑏, which originate from the same
source, while minimizing their similarity to all other samples in the
minibatch. Following SimCLR, the loss function for a given sample
x𝑎
𝑖is defined as:
ℓ𝑎
𝑖=−logexp(𝑠(z𝑎
𝑖,z𝑏
𝑖)/𝜏)
Í𝑁
𝑗=1[exp(𝑠(z𝑎
𝑖,z𝑎
𝑗)/𝜏)+exp(𝑠(z𝑎
𝑖,z𝑏
𝑗)/𝜏)],(4)
where z=𝑔ins(𝑓(x)),𝑠(·,·)is the cosine similarity, and 𝜏is a tem-
perature hyperparameter. The total instance loss, Lins, is computed
as the average over all positive pairs:
Lins=1
2𝑁𝑁∑︁
𝑖=1(ℓ𝑎
𝑖+ℓ𝑏
𝑖). (5)
However, instance-level contrastive learning alone may not be
sufficient to form well-separated clusters. To complement this, we
introduce cluster-level contrastive learning. The hidden state h
from the backbone is fed into a separate cluster projection head,
𝑔clu(·), which outputs a soft label vector y∈R𝑀, representing the
probability of an asset belonging to each of the 𝑀clusters.
Cluster-level contrastive learning treats the cluster assignment
probability vectors from the two augmented views of the same
asset, y𝑎
𝑖andy𝑏
𝑖, as a positive pair. The loss function is designed to
maximize their similarity while minimizing their similarity to the
cluster assignments of all other samples.
ˆℓ𝑎
𝑖=−logexp(𝑠(y𝑎
𝑖,y𝑏
𝑖)/𝜏𝑐)
Í𝑁
𝑗=1[exp(𝑠(y𝑎
𝑖,y𝑎
𝑗)/𝜏𝑐)+exp(𝑠(y𝑎
𝑖,y𝑏
𝑗)/𝜏𝑐)],(6)
where𝜏𝑐is the cluster-level temperature parameter. To prevent a
trivial solution where all assets collapse into a single cluster, we
add a term that maximizes the entropy of the cluster assignments,
H(𝑌). The final cluster loss is:
Lclu=1
2𝑁𝑁∑︁
𝑖=1(ˆℓ𝑎
𝑖+ˆℓ𝑏
𝑖)−H(𝑌). (7)
This dual contrastive learning process enables the model to form se-
mantically consistent clusters based on feature similarity. However,
clusters formed this way do not guarantee statistically significant
trading opportunities, as they are based on feature similarity alone,
not on the strength of their mean-reverting properties. To overcome
this limitation, we introduce the physics-informed regularization,
as described in the next section.3.2.2 Physics-Informed Regularization. Clusters formed by feature
similarity alone do not guarantee statistically significant trading
opportunities. To bridge this gap, we introduce a physics-informed
regularizer based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process, which
models mean-reverting dynamics. We assume that within each
cluster𝑘, asset returns follow a common OU process:
𝑑𝑟𝑡=𝜃𝑘(𝜇𝑘−𝑟𝑡)𝑑𝑡+𝜎𝑘𝑑𝑊𝑡, (8)
where𝑟𝑡represents the return process, 𝜃𝑘is the speed of mean
reversion,𝜇𝑘is the long-term equilibrium return, and 𝜎𝑘is the
volatility for cluster 𝑘. Rather than assuming these parameters are
static, our model dynamically predicts them for each cluster. This is
achieved by first defining a cluster representation vector, ¯h𝑘, which
is the weighted average of the representations of assets assigned to
that cluster:
¯h𝑘=Í
𝑖𝑃𝑖𝑘·h𝑖Í
𝑖𝑃𝑖𝑘+𝜖, (9)
where𝑃𝑖𝑘is the soft probability that asset 𝑖belongs to cluster 𝑘. This
aggregated representation is then fed into a dedicated parameter-
generating neural network, 𝑔OU(·), to yield the cluster’s specific
OU parameters:
[ˆ𝜃𝑘,ˆ𝜇𝑘,ˆ𝜎𝑘]=𝑔OU(¯h𝑘). (10)
This dynamic approach allows the model to derive a cluster’s finan-
cial dynamics from the characteristics of its constituent members.
The physics-informed regularization LPINN measures how well
these parameters explain the observed return dynamics of assets
assigned to each cluster. For asset 𝑖with return series 𝑟𝑖(𝑡), the
discretized residuals, 𝑅𝑖𝑘(𝑡), which represents the deviation from
the predicted OU dynamics of cluster 𝑘:
𝑅𝑖𝑘(𝑡)=(𝑟𝑖(𝑡)−𝑟𝑖(𝑡−Δ𝑡))−ˆ𝜃𝑘(ˆ𝜇𝑘−𝑟𝑖(𝑡−Δ𝑡))Δ𝑡 (11)
Assuming these residuals are Gaussian, the loss is formulated as the
weighted negative log-likelihood. The final physics-informed regu-
larization encourages the model to form clusters whose members
exhibit coherent, predictable mean-reverting behavior:
LPINN=1
𝑁𝑁∑︁
𝑖=1𝐾∑︁
𝑘=1𝑃𝑖𝑘 
log(ˆ𝜎𝑘)+E𝑡[𝑅𝑖𝑘(𝑡)2]·
2ˆ𝜎2
𝑘Δ𝑡!
, (12)
where E𝑡[·]denotes the expectation over time. This loss encourages
the model to form clusters whose members exhibit coherent mean-
reverting dynamics, effectively integrating financial principles into
the clustering objective and producing groups that are inherently
suitable for pairs trading strategies.
3.2.3 Unified Training Objective. The final model is trained end-to-
end by minimizing a single, combined loss function that harmonizes
representation learning, clustering, and financial dynamics:
Ltotal=Lins+𝛼Lclu+𝛽LPINN, (13)
where𝛼and𝛽are hyperparameters that balance the objectives. This
unified training process guides the model to discover clusters that
are not merely similar based on static features, but are inherently
tradable with strong, verifiable mean-reverting characteristics.

3.3 Cluster-Based Trading Strategy
The core contribution of the ORCA framework is not to innovate
the trading rules, but to fundamentally improve the quality of the
asset groups being traded. Therefore, to demonstrate the superi-
ority of the tradable clusters generated by ORCA, we deliberately
apply a simple and conventional mean-reversion trading strategy.
This strategy constructs spreads based on the prior month’s re-
turn ( mom 1) within each cluster and uses a static threshold for
trade execution. The process is as follows. At each rebalancing
period𝑡, ORCA groups all assets into 𝐾clusters,{C1,...,C𝐾}. For
each clusterC𝑘, we determine long and short positions. First, we
sort the assets within the cluster by their prior one-month return,
𝑅𝑡−1, to identify the top-performing (overvalued candidates) and
bottom-performing (undervalued candidates) groups. The return
differential between these two groups defines a momentum spread .
A trading position is then initiated only when an asset’s momentum
spread exceeds a statistically significant level (e.g., a multiple 𝛾of
the standard deviation of all spreads). Long positions are taken
in the assets that have underperformed the most relative to their
cluster peers, and short positions are taken in the assets that have
overperformed the most. By evaluating the performance of this
simple, rule-based strategy when applied to ORCA’s clusters versus
its performance on clusters formed by other methodologies, we can
clearly assess the practical value added by our physics-informed reg-
ularization. The detailed procedure of this strategy is summarized
in Algorithm 1.

In this section, we empirically validate the efficacy of the proposed
method through a series of experiments.
4.1 Experimental Setup
4.1.1 Dataset. We obtain data from the CRSP/Compustat Merged
(CCM) database via WRDS for the period 1999-2023. Our sample
comprises all common stocks (CRSP share codes 10 and 11) listed on
NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ exchanges. We compute monthly total
returns from daily price and volume data, which we then transform
into momentum features following Han et al. [ 14]. Specifically, we
construct 24 momentum features for each stock-month observation:
mom 1=𝑟𝑡−1,
mom𝑖=𝑡−2Ö
𝑗=𝑡−𝑖(1+𝑟𝑗)−1,for𝑖∈{2,..., 24},
where𝑟𝑗denotes the total return in month 𝑗. These features capture
return dynamics across multiple time horizons. From Compustat,
we incorporate key accounting variables updated quarterly: to-
tal assets (ATQ), total liabilities (LTQ), short-term debt (DLCQ),
long-term debt (DLTTQ), shareholders’ equity (SEQQ), cash and
equivalents (CHEQ), net sales (SALEQ), net income (NIQ), operating
income (OIADPQ), pretax income (PIQ), depreciation (DPQ), and
diluted earnings per share (EPSPXQ). These fundamental indicators
provide additional information beyond price momentum.
4.1.2 Backtesting. We conduct a monthly-rebalanced backtesting
spanning 288 months from December 1999 to December 2023. At the
end of each month, we follow a systematic procedure: (1) We group
the entire asset universe into 𝐾clusters using ORCA and each of the
baseline models. (2) Within each cluster, we compute a momentum
spread for each asset based on its rank of the prior month’s return
(mom 1). (3) We take a long position in assets whose spread falls
below−𝛾·𝜎and a short position in those whose spread exceeds 𝛾·𝜎,
where𝛾is the threshold parameter and 𝜎is the standard deviation
of all spreads. For all experiments, we set 𝛾=1.0and𝐾=30. All
positions in the resulting portfolio are equally weighted, and a 10%
stop-loss is applied to each individual position.
4.1.3 Baseline Models. To comprehensively evaluate the cluster-
ing performance of ORCA, we compare its performance against a
diverse set of established methodologies. The baseline models are
categorized into three groups:
•Traditional Clustering: Representative unsupervised algo-
rithms based on the geometric distribution of asset features:
K-Means ,DBSCAN , and Agglomerative Clustering( Agglo ).
•Generative Model-based Clustering: Two-stage approaches
that first learn a latent representation of the data, upon which
a clustering algorithm is subsequently applied. We use a Vari-
ational Autoencoder ( VAE ) [19], a Generative Adversarial
Network ( GAN ) [8], and a Graph Autoencoder ( GAE ) [20] to
extract asset embeddings, and then apply K-Means to these
embeddings to form the final clusters. This category also
includes Variational Deep Embedding ( VaDE ) [16], which
performs latent representation learning and clustering in an
end-to-end fashion.
409
ICAIF ’25, November 15–18, 2025, Singapore, Singapore Kim et al.
•Contrastive-based Clustering: Finally, we include a Con-
trastive Clustering ( CC) [22] methodology, which represents
a state-of-the-art data-driven approach, as a benchmark.
4.1.4 Evaluation Metrics. The performance of each strategy is as-
sessed from multiple perspectives, focusing on risk-adjusted returns.
We measure the portfolio performance using a suite of standard
financial metrics: Annualized Return ( AR), Annualized Volatility
(Vol), Maximum Drawdown ( MDD ), and key risk-adjusted mea-
sures including the Sharpe Ratio ( Sharpe ), Calmar Ratio ( Calmar ),
and Sortino Ratio ( Sortino ).
4.1.5 Implementation. All input features are normalized using a
StandardScaler prior to training. Our model tokenizes the 36
normalized features into 64 bins, which are then embedded into a
128-dimensional hidden space. The transformer encoder consists
of 2 layers with 8 attention heads. We train the model using the
AdamW [23] optimizer with a learning rate of 0.002 and a batch size of
1024. For the unified loss function, Ltotal, the weights for the Lclu,𝛼,
and theLPINN ,𝛽, are both set to 1.0. For data augmentation, we use
a standard deviation of 0.1 for the Gaussian noise and a 10% masking
ratio. All experiments were conducted on a single NVIDIA RTX
3090 GPU with a fixed random seed of 42 for reproducibility. The
backtest follows a monthly rebalancing schedule, where positions
are entered at the beginning of each month and liquidated at the
end.
4.2 Main Results
Figure 3: Cumulative returns of trading strategies from 2000
to 2023.
As shown in Table 1, the proposed model, ORCA, achieves su-
perior performance over benchmark clustering methods across
major metrics, with the exception of volatility. This demonstrates
the superior ability of our framework to identify genuinely trad-
able asset clusters. ORCA achieves superior performance across all
key metrics. With an annualized return of 36.80%, it outperforms
the strongest baseline, Contrastive Clustering (CC), by 1.6 percent-
age points. Crucially, this enhanced return comes with reduced
risk—ORCA exhibits the lowest maximum drawdown at 17.18%,
demonstrating the stability of our physics-informed clusters. Figure
3 illustrates the cumulative returns over the entire test period, show-
ing ORCA’s consistent outperformance. The risk-adjusted metrics
further validate our approach. ORCA attains the highest SharpeAR Vol MDD Sharpe Sortino Calmar

Table 1: Performance comparison across clustering meth-
ods. ORCA consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving
36.80% annualized return with the lowest maximum draw-
down (17.18%). Traditional clustering methods and market
benchmarks show substantially inferior performance.

ratio (2.87), Sortino ratio (3.34), and Calmar ratio (1.97), indicating
that performance gains stem from improved cluster quality rather
than increased risk exposure. The elevated Calmar and Sortino
ratios specifically confirm that our OU process regularization ef-
fectively identifies clusters with robust mean-reverting properties.
While traditional clustering methods exhibit low volatility, they fail
to capture profitable trading opportunities, yielding inferior risk-
adjusted returns. Even the state-of-the-art deep learning baseline
(CC) falls short of ORCA’s performance across all metrics. These
empirical results validate our core hypothesis: incorporating finan-
cial dynamics through physics-informed regularization produces
asset groupings that are fundamentally more suitable for trading
strategies.
4.3 Robustness Analysis
To assess the consistency of ORCA’s performance across varying
market conditions, we partition the test period into non-overlapping
5-year intervals (2000-2004, 2005-2009, 2010-2014, 2015-2019, 2020-
2023) and compute risk-adjusted metrics for each sub-period. Figure
4 presents the distribution of Sharpe, Sortino, and Calmar ratios
across these intervals. ORCA demonstrates superior performance
stability, maintaining the highest median values (indicated by hori-
zontal bars) across all three metrics while exhibiting comparable
variance to baseline methods. The compact distribution of ORCA’s
performance metrics indicates robust returns without excessive

volatility across different market regimes, including the 2008 finan-
cial crisis and 2020 pandemic periods. Notably, while traditional
clustering approaches show consistent but mediocre performance,
and deep learning baselines (CC, VAE) exhibit higher variance,
ORCA achieves an optimal balance between return magnitude and
stability. This empirical evidence confirms that physics-informed
regularization produces clusters with persistent mean-reverting
properties, enabling consistent strategy performance independent
of market conditions. The results validate that ORCA’s superior risk-
adjusted returns are not artifacts of specific market environments
but reflect fundamental improvements in cluster quality through
the integration of financial dynamics into the learning objective.

Table 2: Ablation Study of ORCA Components
We conduct a systematic ablation study to assess the contribu-
tion of each component in ORCA, with results summarized in Table
2. The analysis confirms that high-quality representation learning is
foundational to our approach, as removing either the instance-level
contrastive loss (Lins) or the Piece-wise Linear Encoding (PLE)
leads to significant performance degradation. Most critically, the
study highlights the unique role of the physics-informed regular-
ization (LPINN ). While its removal results in only a modest decline
in the Sharpe ratio (2.873 to 2.828), it critically increases the Max-
imum Drawdown from 17.2% to 18.7%—an 8.7% relative increase
in downside risk. This finding provides strong evidence that the
primary function of the PINN regularizer is to enhance portfolio
stability and control for downside risk by enforcing stable mean-
reverting dynamics within the clusters. The complementary role of
each component validates our integrated design.
4.5 Sensitivity Analysis
Figure 5: Sensitivity analysis of ORCA performance across
key hyperparameters. Risk-adjusted metrics are evaluated
while varying (a) the number of encoder layers, (b) the num-
ber of attention heads, and (c) the PINN weight 𝛽.
We examine ORCA’s sensitivity to key hyperparameters through
systematic variation of architectural components and regularizationstrength. Figure 5 presents the impact on risk-adjusted performance
metrics. The model demonstrates remarkable stability across archi-
tectural variations. Varying the number of encoder layers from 2 to
6 yields only marginal changes in Sharpe ratio (2.875 to 2.726), with
2 layers surprisingly achieving the best performance. This suggests
that the physics-informed regularization effectively guides learn-
ing even with minimal architectural depth. Similarly, increasing
attention heads from 4 to 8 shows negligible impact on all met-
rics, indicating that the model does not require extensive attention
mechanisms to capture relevant asset relationships. The PINN reg-
ularization weight 𝛽exhibits a clear optimal value at 1.0, where
all three risk-adjusted metrics reach their peak. Underweighting
(𝛽=0.1) reduces the Sharpe ratio to 2.748 and Calmar ratio to 1.646,
confirming insufficient physics-based guidance. Conversely, over-
weighting (𝛽=10.0) slightly degrades performance, suggesting that
excessive physics constraints can overshadow the data-driven learn-
ing. The convex relationship validates our choice of unit weighting
as an effective balance between empirical patterns and theoretical
priors.
5 Conclusion
This study introduces ORCA (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Reversion and
Contrastive Arbitrage), a novel approach designed to identify in-
herently tradable asset groups by integrating financial dynamics di-
rectly into the learning objective. ORCA leverages physics-informed
regularization based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, thus en-
suring that identified asset clusters exhibit genuine and stable mean-
reverting properties conducive to statistical arbitrage. Empirical
validation performed on U.S. equities from 2000 to 2023 demon-
strates that ORCA consistently outperforms benchmark clustering
methods, achieving notably superior risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe
ratio: 2.87) and minimal maximum drawdown (17.18%), highlighting
the value of incorporating domain-specific insights into represen-
tation learning.
The core innovation of ORCA resides in the concurrent optimiza-
tion of a contrastive learning mechanism and a PINN regularizer
within a single unified framework. Contrastive learning effectively
captures complex nonlinear relationships among assets through
deep representation learning, while the PINN module enforces ad-
herence to stable mean-reverting dynamics. This integrative strat-
egy directly addresses a principal challenge of traditional pairs
trading methodologies—identifying asset clusters characterized by
robust and actionable mean-reversion properties beyond mere sta-
tistical similarities.
Despite these advancements, several limitations warrant future
investigation. Firstly, the fixed monthly rebalancing strategy poten-
tially overlooks intramonth trading opportunities, suggesting future
improvements could incorporate adaptive rebalancing schedules.
Secondly, the static, threshold-based position selection mechanism
currently employed is likely suboptimal under changing market
conditions. Future research could beneficially explore reinforce-
ment learning techniques to dynamically optimize position entry
thresholds and portfolio allocations based on prevailing market
dynamics and cluster stability metrics.
In conclusion, incorporating domain-specific physical constraints
significantly enhances the effectiveness and practical applicability
