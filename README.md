# Deep Potential Arbitrage

## Project Overview

**Dual Objectives:**
1. Develop a profitable, production-ready pair trading strategy
2. Publish research at top-tier computer science conferences

**Core Innovation:** GNN-based stock clustering guided by potential energy dynamics, using first and second derivatives of individual stock potential to identify cluster deviations and trading opportunities.
